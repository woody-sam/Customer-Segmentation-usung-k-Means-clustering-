OVERVIEW

Customer segmentation is the process of segmenting customers of a company into distinct groups or segments based on specific characteristics, behaviors, or needs.
The ultimate objective of this type of segmentation is to identify groups of customers who share similar attributes, 
this would allow businesses to adapt marketing strategies, products, and services more effectively to the respective customer segments.

 Key Aspects of Customer Segmentation:
1. Demographic Segmentation:
- Segments consumers according to their age, sex, income, education, occupation, etc.

2. Geographic Segmentation:
   - Segments consumers into country, city, or neighborhood.

3. Behavioral Segmentation:
   - Customer behavioral consumption, usage, brand loyalty, and purchase patterns.

4. Psychographic Segmentation:
   - Segments customers into lifestyle, personality traits, values, and interests.

5. Firmographic Segmentation:
Applied to B2B markets, this would entail industry categorization, company size, and revenue.

 Benefits of Customer Segmentation:
 - Personalized Marketing: In the case of segmentation, a business can run campaigns focused on targeted segments.
 - Improved Customer Retention: The services or products can be offered to fit the exact needs of customers in each segment.
 - Efficient Resource Allocation: It allows better allocation of marketing resources toward high-value segments.
Increased Customer Satisfaction: It provides a more personalized experience that resonates with the individual segments.

Example:
It could categorize retail buyers into groups such as high-income, luxury shoppers, budget-conscious, deal-seeking customers, frequent, loyal shoppers, or occasional, one-time buyers.

Customer segmentation would thus provide relevant promotions, recommendations of products, or loyalty programs that would heighten customer activity and satisfaction.
